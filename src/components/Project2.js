            <h2 className='subtitle-content'>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <p className='content'>
                FifaAddict, a key tool for the gaming community of FIFA Online 4, required a major redesign to enhance user experience and accessibility. Initially overwhelmed by its cluttered design and poor navigational structure, I saw an opportunity to streamline its functionality and aesthetic to better serve its users.

            <h2 className='subtitle-content'>Initial Research and User Feedback</h2>
            <p className='content'>
                My approach began with user feedback and an analysis using tools like WebAIM to identify critical usability and accessibility issues. Common feedback highlighted the overwhelming nature of the homepage and the difficulty in navigating through dense, poorly contrasted text.
            </p>

            <h2 className='subtitle-content'>Design Iterations and Decisions</h2>
            <p className='content'>
                The redesign process involved multiple sketches and wireframes, focusing on simplifying the interface and prioritizing the search functionality, essential for player database navigation. Each iteration aimed to declutter the interface, improve text readability, and enhance overall navigational flow.

            <h2 className='subtitle-content'>Developing the Solution</h2>
            <p className='content'>
                Utilizing React, I transformed these designs into a dynamic and responsive web interface. The new layout was structured around a clear visual hierarchy, employing a Z-pattern design to guide the userâ€™s eye through the most important elements seamlessly.

            <p className='content'>
                Highlights of the redesign include:
                <ul>
                    <li>A focused search bar prominently placed for ease of use.</li>
                    <li>High-contrast color scheme and larger text for better readability and accessibility.</li>
